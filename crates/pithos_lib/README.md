# Pithos library

`pithos_lib` is the public Rust API for creating, opening, reading, extending, extracting, and adapting encrypted Pithos archives. It has no network client or transport policy.

## Installation

Add the crate to an application using Rust 1.88 or newer:

```toml
[dependencies]
pithos_lib = "0.8"
```

## Create an archive

This example encrypts a local file for its owner. The recipient public key is derived from the private key only for a self-contained example; production applications should provide the intended recipients' public keys.

```rust,no_run
use pithos_lib::archive::{
    ArchivePath, ArchiveWriter, EntryMetadata, ProcessingOptions, WriteOptions,
};
use pithos_lib::crypto::PrivateKey;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let owner = PrivateKey::from_private_pem_bytes(&std::fs::read("owner.pem")?)?;
    let recipient = owner.public_key();
    let input = File::open("report.txt")?;
    let size = input.metadata()?.len();
    let output = File::create("report.pith")?;

    let mut writer = ArchiveWriter::create(output, WriteOptions::new(owner, vec![recipient]))?;
    writer.add_file(
        ArchivePath::new("report.txt")?,
        EntryMetadata::new(0, 0, 0o644),
        ProcessingOptions::default(),
        Some(size),
        input,
    )?;
    writer.finish()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

See [`examples/create.rs`](examples/create.rs) for the maintained version and the [CLI guide](../pithos/README.md) for a command-line workflow.

## Public API

- Create archives with `archive::ArchiveWriter`, `archive::WriteOptions`, and `crypto` keys.
- Open an immutable `archive::Archive` from a `source::ArchiveSource`, such as `source::FileSource` or `source::MemorySource`.
- Read a complete entry with `copy_to` or a checked range with `copy_range_to`.
- Use `fs::extract`, `fs::append_files`, `fs::grant_readers`, and `fs::ingest` for Linux host operations.
- Use `adapters::ro_crate` for local directory/ZIP conversion and `adapters::crypt4gh::export` for Crypt4GH output.

Compiled examples are included with the package: [`create`](examples/create.rs), [`open_list`](examples/open_list.rs), [`read_ranges`](examples/read_ranges.rs), [`extract`](examples/extract.rs), [`append`](examples/append.rs), [`grant_readers`](examples/grant_readers.rs), [`ro_crate`](examples/ro_crate.rs), and [`crypt4gh`](examples/crypt4gh.rs). They are local-only and return errors to their caller.

Version 0.8 deliberately removes old model, helper, and wire-record access from the public API. Use the typed archive API instead. The [format draft](https://github.com/arunaengine/pithos/blob/main/spec/PITHOS_1.0.0_draft.md) is background information, not a complete interoperability guarantee.

## Read and extract semantics

Opening validates archive structure and accessible metadata. Payload integrity is lazy: each block is verified when it is read. `copy_to` and `copy_range_to` do not write bytes from a failed block, but a generic sink can retain earlier verified blocks if a later block fails. `PithosError::ContentUnavailable` means the entry is present but no supplied key can access its content; it is different from an integrity or corruption error.

`fs::extract` is Linux-only. It walks destination components without following symlinks, stages regular-file output anonymously with Linux `O_TMPFILE`, and publishes without replacing an existing entry. The destination filesystem must support `O_TMPFILE` and `linkat(AT_EMPTY_PATH)`; extraction can therefore fail on a collision rather than overwrite a destination.

## RO-Crate ingestion

Load a directory or ZIP RO-Crate, then convert its retained source through a configured writer:

```rust,no_run
use pithos_lib::adapters::ro_crate::{read_ro_crate_directory, write_ro_crate};
use pithos_lib::archive::ProcessingOptions;

# fn convert<W: std::io::Write>(writer: &mut pithos_lib::archive::ArchiveWriter<W>) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error> {
let loaded = read_ro_crate_directory("path/to/ro-crate")?;
write_ro_crate(writer, loaded, ProcessingOptions::default())?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The upstream parser accepts RO-Crate 1.1 and 1.2 metadata without upstream validation or warning emission; Pithos then applies its own source, path, limit, metadata, and conversion policy. Conversion stores the inspected `ro-crate-metadata.json` bytes rather than reserializing the graph. ZIP conversion streams retained members and does not extract them first.

## Platform behavior

Filesystem ingestion, extraction, append, and grants are Linux-only in 0.8. Append uses a cooperating-writer advisory lock and can request `AppendDurability::SyncAll`; it attempts to truncate a failed child directory, but it cannot promise rollback after an unrecoverable host or power failure.
