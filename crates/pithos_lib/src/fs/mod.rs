//! Linux filesystem adapters.
//!
//! Ingestion, extraction, append, and reader grants are Linux-only host operations.
//! They keep no-follow traversal, retained source identity, metadata normalization,
//! and filesystem error context out of the core archive and format layers. Extraction
//! stages regular files and publishes without clobbering an existing destination;
//! append and grants use an advisory lock that coordinates only participating writers.
